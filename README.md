# rCalc

A complete but "simple" calculator writen in jQuery and html

## Synopsis

Hello Everyone!
This is my first repository, 2 days ago ive seen a calculator made in javascript, im not sayin main is better, 
but i wanted to give it a try and create one by myself, so, here it is...
I made it on codepen first using jQuery library, im new in javascript, i made a "buy your car insurance" webapp writen in php and jquery
in my job, I cant publish that because is private, but with that ive learned enough, so this is my first jquery little app too.

## Motivation

Im a business area developer, all my codes are private so i cant share it with all of you, im new in this "mobile and public" world of development
so i started this little app :)

## Installation

the good and old "copy and paste"

## API Reference

jQuery 3.1.1, thats all

## Tests

just use it ;)
